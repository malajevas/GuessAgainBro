### Description
##### Our web app is essentially a fully C++ written alternative to Worlde.


### How to launch:
Open cmd, use make in root folder, start app.exe.
Then go to front/word-guesser-app and do npm start to launch frontend. The folders are files are a mess right now, until next task I'll tidy it up.
